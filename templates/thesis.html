            <p class='project-des'> <i> <b>Abstract</b> : </i>The coastline of a country plays innate role in a country’s geo-political, socio-economical
                and development aspect. Sediment load has direct impact to the biodiversity deep
                under the sea as well as on the agricultural economy of a country. Constant monitoring and 
                data analysis of sedimentation load thus becomes very important. Remotely sensed satellite 
                information is one of the most efficient and reliable way to get
                data and in recent times, satellite data availability has increased significantly, helping
                researchers worldwide to explore, analyze and approach different problems using the most recent 
                computer vision techniques. In this work, we created dataset of
                Bangladesh marine area sedimentation for segmenting sediment load into 5 different
                classes (Land, High Sediment, Moderate Sediment, Low Sediment and No Sediment).
                We used a modified U-Net architecture to segment our training images using corresponding label masks. 
                As high-resolution satellite images are immense in size, we applied a patch-wise learning approach. The Segmentation
                model performed best with Dec-2019 dataset with validation dice coefficient of 87.81%, validation loss of 0.60 
                and validation pixel accuracy of 78.97%. We further tested our models performance under 
                three kinds of label noise (NCAR, NAR and NNAR). We found that for NCAR, performance of the model 
                decreased slightly as we increase the percentage of noise. For NAR, after a certain level of rotation 
                the models performance changes drastically and for NNAR model completely gets confused and
                makes random guesses for most of the pixels. </p>

                <p class='project-des'> <i> <b>Study Objective</b> : </i>
                The overall maritime boundary of Bangladesh expands up-to 354 NM which includes
                12 NM of sovereign right over the resources and an economic marine zone of 200 NM. 
                This marine boundary of Bangladesh has a great impact on the country’s overall
                economy. Thus, understanding the load of sedimentation in this huge marine region,
                holds a great impact in several related sectors like marine biology, blue economy
                and aquaculture. Conducting field research in this enormous areas can both be effort-taking
                and costly. Satellite image can aid the purpose of diverse study in marine area
                using the most recent techniques in machine learning paradigm. Crucial cases such
                as soil erosion, flood management, oceanology and biodiversity under the sea can be
                greatly benefited by using these techniques.
